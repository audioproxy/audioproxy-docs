<!-- authored here; the API contract is canonical for the exact grammar -->

Three things tell you what a running proxy is doing: the request log, the
Prometheus endpoint, and the readiness endpoint. This page covers the
first two. Readiness is a routing decision rather than an observation, so
it lives in [Scaling](/guides/scaling/#health-and-readiness).

## The request log

Everything goes to stdout, one line per completed request:

```
12:31:07.442 request_id=GMf5ECU8WG_tDMEAAAJC [info] render 200 opts=br:96/f:opus src=local://piece.wav cache=MISS 27141 bytes in 63.4ms
12:31:07.981 request_id=GMf5ECU9xK2sPQ1AAAJD [info] render 200 opts=br:96/f:opus src=local://piece.wav cache=COALESCED 27141 bytes in 2.8ms
12:31:09.118 request_id=GMf5EGolMMyBOD4AAA7B [info] render 422 invalid_options 74 bytes in 0.3ms
12:31:11.006 request_id=GMf5ECRh8raItPUAAAOl [warning] render 504 render_timeout opts=f:mp3 src=local://long.wav cache=MISS 72 bytes in 300004.7ms
```

Reading one left to right: the endpoint class (the same seven values the
`endpoint` metrics label carries, below), the status, the
[error code](/reference/errors/) when the request failed, the normalized
options string and the canonical source once the proxy has got far enough
to know them (a `401` knows neither and omits both), whether the request
rendered or shared one, the bytes sent, and how long it took.

**`cache=` is the field to read before drawing conclusions from a
duration.** The second line above delivered the same 27 kB as the first in
a fortieth of the time because it attached to the render already running
for that variant, not because ffmpeg was fast.

`request_id` is on every line, and the same id comes back to the client in
the `x-request-id` response header, so a report of "this URL was slow at
12:31" can be traced to the render behind it. Send your own
`x-request-id` and it is used instead, which is what makes the log line up
with a proxy or gateway in front.

### Levels

| Level | What appears |
|---|---|
| `error` | Nothing routine: a missing `ffmpeg` or `ffprobe` on `PATH`, a subprocess that survived `SIGKILL`, a probe coordinator that died, a failure to signal an OS process, and crashes |
| `warning` | `5xx` and `504` responses, and the ffmpeg diagnostic behind a failed render |
| `info` | **Default.** The above, plus one line per request, `4xx` included: a `401` is a normal outcome for a public endpoint, not an incident |
| `debug` | The above, plus `/health`, `/ready` and `/metrics` (silent otherwise, so a liveness probe every second and a scrape every fifteen do not become the log), the render lifecycle, and client disconnects |

Set the floor with `AP_LOG_LEVEL`. `warning` is the setting for a busy
production instance that wants failures only.

**Presigned URLs and credentials never appear.** Sources are logged by
their canonical identity (`local://piece.wav`), never by what ffmpeg was
handed to read, and diagnostics quoted back from ffmpeg have their query
strings stripped.

Structured JSON output is not implemented yet.

## Metrics

`GET /metrics` answers in Prometheus text format. It is unsigned, and it
is served on **its own listener**, bound by default to `127.0.0.1:9568`.
A sidecar scraper and a `kubectl port-forward` reach it, and nothing
off-host does. The bind is the access control, so widening it is a
deliberate act.

```console
$ curl -s localhost:9568/metrics | head -3
# HELP audio_proxy_renders_total Renders that finished, by output format and outcome.
# TYPE audio_proxy_renders_total counter
audio_proxy_renders_total{format="mp3",outcome="success"} 412
```

`AP_PORT` does not serve it: a request for `/metrics` there is a `404`.

### What is exported

| Metric | Type | Labels |
|---|---|---|
| `audio_proxy_renders_total` | counter | `format`, `outcome` |
| `audio_proxy_render_duration_seconds` | histogram | `format`, `outcome` |
| `audio_proxy_renders_running` | gauge | |
| `audio_proxy_render_slots_held` | gauge | |
| `audio_proxy_render_slots_capacity` | gauge | |
| `audio_proxy_render_queue_depth` | gauge | |
| `audio_proxy_render_queue_capacity` | gauge | |
| `audio_proxy_render_queue_rejections_total` | counter | |
| `audio_proxy_cache_lookups_total` | counter | `format`, `outcome` |
| `audio_proxy_variant_store_write_failures_total` | counter | |
| `audio_proxy_http_requests_total` | counter | `endpoint`, `status` |

`format` is the output format (`mp3`, `opus`, `peaks`, …). `outcome` on a
render is `success`, `cancelled` (the client went away mid-stream), or the
failure class from the [error table](/reference/errors/); on a cache
lookup it is `hit`, `miss` or `coalesced`, the same three values the
`X-Audio-Proxy` response header carries. `endpoint` is the route class
(`render`, `info`, `health`, `ready`, `metrics`, `preflight`, `unknown`) and
`status` a code family (`2xx`, `4xx`, …).

**Every label is a fixed, bounded set.** Nothing derived from a request,
not the source, not the options, not the cache key, becomes a label, so no
client can grow your scraper's series count.

`renders_running` counts *renders*, not requests: twenty clients coalesced
onto one encode are one running render, which is what
`AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` counts too.

Duration buckets are fixed at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120
and 300 seconds. They are not configurable, so the histogram stays
aggregatable across nodes and across releases.

### Scrape config

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: audio_proxy
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["127.0.0.1:9568"]
```

In a container, `127.0.0.1` is the pod, not the host. A sidecar scraper in
the same pod works unchanged, and a scraper elsewhere needs
`AP_METRICS_BIND=0.0.0.0` plus a network policy that keeps the port to
your monitoring namespace.

On Kubernetes, declare the port on the pod and point a `PodMonitor` at it
rather than exposing it through the Service that serves audio.

## The four signals

```promql
# Saturation: how much of this node's render budget is in use. The leading
# signal is the queue behind it; the slots are full long before it grows.
sum(audio_proxy_render_slots_held) / sum(audio_proxy_render_slots_capacity)
sum(audio_proxy_render_queue_depth)

# Latency: the 95th percentile render, by format. Split by format because a
# full-length FLAC and a 30-second Opus preview are not the same workload.
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (format, le) (rate(audio_proxy_render_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)

# Cache efficiency: the share of requests that cost no encode at all. This is
# the number the proxy exists to move.
sum(rate(audio_proxy_cache_lookups_total{outcome=~"hit|coalesced"}[5m]))
  / sum(rate(audio_proxy_cache_lookups_total[5m]))

# Errors: the share of renders that did not deliver, and the load being shed.
sum(rate(audio_proxy_renders_total{outcome!~"success|cancelled"}[5m]))
  / sum(rate(audio_proxy_renders_total[5m]))
rate(audio_proxy_render_queue_rejections_total[5m])
```

Two more worth an alert.

**`audio_proxy_variant_store_write_failures_total` moving at all** means
the cache has silently stopped filling. Clients are still being served, so
nothing else reports it, and the hit ratio decays over hours. See
[Variant store](/guides/variant-store/).

**`audio_proxy_render_queue_depth`** is the leading signal for
autoscaling: target it well below `AP_READY_QUEUE_THRESHOLD` so the fleet
grows before nodes start shedding. See
[Scaling](/guides/scaling/#autoscaling).
