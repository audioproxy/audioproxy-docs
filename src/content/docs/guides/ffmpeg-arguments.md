Synced from [`audioproxy@4e37081`](https://github.com/audioproxy/audioproxy/blob/4e37081/docs/ffmpeg-arguments.md) — that repo is canonical; edit there, then re-run `bin/sync-proxy-docs`.
:::

Implementation reference for `AudioProxy.Ffmpeg.Command`. Nothing here is
needed to *use* the proxy — the option grammar in the
[README](https://github.com/audioproxy/audioproxy/blob/main/README.md#processing-options) and
[audio-proxy-api-v1.md](/reference/api-v1/) cover that. Read this when a
render produces something you did not expect, or before changing the argument
table.

`AudioProxy.Ffmpeg.Command.build/3` turns a validated options struct plus an
input URL into an argv list. It is a pure function and it is the last leg of
the round-trip: equal cache keys imply byte-identical commands, which is what
makes a cache hit a claim about bytes rather than about a URL.

```elixir
{:ok, opts} = AudioProxy.Options.parse("f:opus/br:96/t:12.5:30/fade:0.5:1")
AudioProxy.Ffmpeg.Command.build(opts, "https://masters.example/piece.wav",
                                type: :http)
# => ["-nostdin", "-hide_banner", "-loglevel", "error",
#     "-protocol_whitelist", "https,tls,tcp",
#     "-ss", "12.5", "-t", "30", "-i", "https://masters.example/piece.wav",
#     "-vn", "-sn", "-dn", "-af", "afade=t=in:st=0:d=0.5,afade=t=out:st=29:d=1",
#     "-c:a", "libopus", "-b:a", "96k", "-f", "ogg", "pipe:1"]
```

There is no shell anywhere in this path. The argv is a flat list of complete
arguments, so a source URL containing `;`, `$(…)` or spaces is one element and
stays data; `dl` and `cb` never reach the command at all.

The `type:` is the resolved source's own tag and it is required — see
[Audio only, at the argv](#audio-only-at-the-argv) for what it decides and why
there is no default.

## Option → ffmpeg mapping

| Option | ffmpeg | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `t:START[:DUR]` | `-ss START [-t DUR]` **before** `-i` | Input seeking, so ffmpeg's HTTP client issues a Range request and never reads the skipped bytes. Everything downstream sees the trimmed region starting at t=0 |
| `fade:IN[:OUT]` | `afade=t=in:st=0:d=IN`, `afade=t=out:st=DUR-OUT:d=OUT` | Inside the trimmed region, by construction |
| `gain` | `volume=<dB>dB` | |
| `norm:ebu:I:TP:LRA` | `loudnorm=I=…:TP=…:LRA=…` | Single-pass (§3.2) |
| `sr` | `aresample=<Hz>` | |
| `ch` | `-ac 1` \| `-ac 2` | An output option, not a filter. Omitted, the render follows the source — except under `f:peaks`, which emits `-ac 1`; see below |
| `br` | `-b:a <kbps>k` | Lossy formats only |
| `q` | `-q:a` (mp3, ogg, aac, m4a) or `-compression_level` (opus, flac) | Whichever knob the codec has, bounded to its range |
| `bd` | `-c:a pcm_s16le`/`pcm_s24le`/`pcm_f32le` (wav), `-sample_fmt s16`/`s32` (flac) | Omitted, a lossless variant follows the source's depth |
| `f:mp3` | `-c:a libmp3lame -f mp3` | |
| `f:opus` | `-c:a libopus -f ogg` | |
| `f:ogg` | `-c:a libvorbis -f ogg` | |
| `f:aac` | `-c:a aac -f adts` | ADTS, because it streams |
| `f:m4a` | `-c:a aac -movflags empty_moov+default_base_moof -frag_duration 1000000 -f mp4` | Fragmented: plain MP4 needs a seekable output for its moov atom, and stdout is not one. Cut on duration, not `frag_keyframe` — see below |
| `f:flac` | `-c:a flac -f flac` | |
| `f:wav` | `-c:a pcm_s16le -f wav` | |
| `f:peaks` | `-c:a pcm_s16le -f s16le -ac 1` | Raw PCM for the peak reducer, not an encode. See below |

Every command writes to `pipe:1` behind an explicit `-f`, since stdout has no
filename for ffmpeg to infer a muxer from, and every command runs with
`-nostdin -hide_banner -loglevel error` so stderr carries diagnostics only.

## Audio only, at the argv

Two things appear in every argv regardless of the options, and neither comes
from the URL:

| Argument | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `-vn -sn -dn` | after `-i`, so they bind the output | No video, subtitle or data stream is decoded, filtered or encoded, in any format and on the peaks PCM path too |
| `-protocol_whitelist <set>` | before `-i`, so it binds the input | ffmpeg may open only the protocols the resolved source actually needs |

The protocol set is a function of the source's *type*, never of the input
string and never of configuration:

| Source | Set | Reachable |
|---|---|---|
| `local://` | `file` | The filesystem only — no network protocol exists in this invocation |
| `https://` | `https,tls,tcp` | The network only — no `file`, so a redirect to `file:///etc/passwd` fails to open |
| `s3://` | `https,tls,tcp`, plus `http` when `AP_S3_ENDPOINT` is cleartext | As above; the presigned URL's scheme follows the endpoint |

The two sets are disjoint by construction, which is the property that makes
them worth having: a local render cannot fetch, a remote render cannot read
disk, and `concat:`, `subfile:`, `data:` and the rest are reachable from
neither. Because the set is derived from the source type, `build/3` requires
`type:` rather than defaulting it — a default would be a guess about which side
of that boundary a render sits on, and the wrong guess is a hole rather than a
crash. A source type with no entry in `protocols/1` raises for the same reason.

These are defence in depth, and one concrete case shows why they are not
redundant. The gate exempts cover art by trusting the `attached_pic`
disposition, which lives in the container — bytes the requester may control — so
a crafted file can wear it and pass. What that buys is bounded here rather than
there: with `-vn -sn -dn` the video stream is never mapped, so the render is an
audio-only encode of the audio track. The attacker gets audio extraction from a
video file, which is what the gate exists to refuse, and not a video transcode,
which is what would actually cost the operator. Layer one is the policy; layer
two is what makes forging layer one uninteresting.

The gate that actually refuses a video source with `415` is an `ffprobe` run in
`AudioProxy.Plugs.RenderAction`, before the semaphore; the flags above are what
still holds if that gate is bypassed, reordered, or handed a source it cannot
see inside. Placement matters for both:
`-protocol_whitelist` after `-i` would bind the *output* format context and
protect nothing, and `-vn` before `-i` would be an input option ffmpeg reads
differently.

`Command.allowed_flags/0` publishes the complete flag vocabulary, and
`takes_value?/1` says which flags carry a value. The property suite walks a
generated argv position by position against both, so "no URL content can become
an ffmpeg flag" is a checked claim rather than a design intention. The walk is
necessary rather than decorative: ogg's quality scale starts at −1, so
`f:ogg/q:-1` renders `["-q:a", "-1"]` and a leading-hyphen check would have to
be loosened to tolerate it.

Two subprocesses read the source, not one, so both carry a whitelist. The
decode's is in the argv above; the probe's comes from `Ffprobe.args/2`, which
takes the protocol set as an argument rather than an option precisely because
`AudioProxy.Peaks.Render` builds its own probe argv (see below) and would
otherwise be the one route reading a source unrestricted.

## Why `f:peaks` runs ffmpeg twice, and why it is mono

Peaks are the one format where ffmpeg does not produce the response. It
decodes to raw interleaved `s16le` on stdout and `AudioProxy.Peaks` reduces
those samples to `pts` min/max pairs; the PCM is folded in chunk by chunk and
dropped, so a ten-minute source costs a few kilobytes of resident state rather
than the tens of megabytes it decodes to.

Streaming that reduction is what forces the **leading `ffprobe`**. Bucket
boundaries are `ceil(frames / pts)` and have to be known before the first
sample arrives; the alternative is buffering the whole decode and counting
afterwards, which trades a header read for memory proportional to the source.
So a peaks render is a probe and then a decode, both spawned through the same
render pipeline — same kill discipline, same `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT`, same stderr
classification, which is why a 404 source fails a peaks request with the
status it would have failed an audio one with.

Probe and decode can disagree about the sample count by a frame or two, and
neither direction is reported: extra samples fold into the final bucket, and a
short decode leaves trailing pairs at `0, 0`. `length` is always the `pts` the
URL asked for.

The `-ac 1` is the other peaks-only rule. Every other format follows the
source when `ch` is absent; peaks downmix, because a waveform UI draws one
shape and following a stereo source would double the payload for a picture
nobody asked for. The reducer also has to know the interleaving before it
reads a byte, so "whatever the source had" is not an option the argv can leave
open. `ch:2` still gives per-channel pairs, and the mono default is
materialized into the cache key so `f:peaks` and `f:peaks/ch:1` are one
variant.

## Why `m4a` fragments on duration

`-movflags frag_keyframe` starts a new fragment at each video keyframe. An
audio-only stream has none, so `empty_moov` alone produces exactly **one**
fragment, which ffmpeg flushes when the input ends — a valid file on a
non-seekable pipe, but not a stream. Measured on a 20 s source fed at realtime:

| movflags | first bytes | fragments | size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `frag_keyframe+empty_moov` | 19.7 s | 1 | 328218 |
| `empty_moov+default_base_moof` + `-frag_duration 1000000` | 1.8 s | 20 | 327275 |
| `empty_moov+frag_every_frame` | 0.2 s | 863 | 437684 |
| mp3, for reference | 0.2 s | — | — |

One-second fragments cost nothing measurable in size and make the stream a
stream, so that is what the builder emits. The `:ffmpeg`-tagged suite counts
the fragments and measures time-to-first-byte, so the regression cannot come
back quietly.

Filters run in the order `loudnorm → volume → aresample → afade`, and the
order is load-bearing. `loudnorm` goes first because normalizing after a
static `gain` would undo it; `aresample` follows it because single-pass
`loudnorm` resamples its output to 192 kHz; `afade` goes last so the fade
shape survives the stages above it.

That 192 kHz has one visible consequence: **`norm` without an explicit `sr`
appends `aresample=48000`.** Without it every normalized render would be a
192 kHz file. 48 kHz is the API's own lossy ceiling (§3.1) and universally
supported, but it does mean `norm` on a 96 kHz lossless master downsamples.
Choosing better would need the source's real sample rate, which the argument
builder deliberately does not know — it is a pure function of the options, and
that purity is what the round-trip property rests on. Pass `sr` explicitly to
override.

## ffmpeg version

The argv is a contract with a specific ffmpeg, not with "ffmpeg" in the
abstract: encoder names, muxer names and filter option spellings all drift
between versions. The devcontainer and the release image therefore install
ffmpeg from the same distro packaging, and the `:ffmpeg`-tagged tests
(`test/audio_proxy/ffmpeg/command_ffmpeg_test.exs`) run every format and every
filter through the real binary, so a codec name that a build does not carry
fails a test rather than a request. Pinning an exact ffmpeg version — and
whether to build it from source with a trimmed codec set — is decided in
`add-docker-release`.

Two known gaps. libopus encodes at 48/24/16/12/8 kHz only, so `sr:44100` with
`f:opus` is resampled to 48 kHz by ffmpeg's own negotiation and produces the
same bytes as `f:opus` alone, under a different cache key. And with no `bd`,
`f:wav` falls back to 16-bit whenever the source's depth is unknown — the
builder takes it as an argument (`build/3`), but the probe that supplies it
belongs to the `/info` slice, so until then a 24-bit master requested as
`f:wav` comes back 16-bit unless `bd:24` is given. Both cost a duplicate cache
object or a documented fallback, not a wrong render, and both are tracked
alongside the semantic no-ops described under
[cache-key semantics](https://github.com/audioproxy/audioproxy/blob/main/README.md#cache-key-semantics).
