<!-- synced 1:1 from audioproxy@f72bb77 docs/audio-proxy-api-v1.md; the contract is canonical there -->

An imgproxy-style on-the-fly audio transcoding proxy. Sources live in S3 (or any HTTP-reachable store); variants are rendered on demand, streamed to the first requester, and written back to a variant bucket for cached, range-capable serving thereafter.

Design principles, in order: URLs are the entire API (no request bodies, no state); every variant is fully described by its processing options, which double as the cache key; everything is signed.

---

## 1. URL structure

```
GET /{signature}/{options}/{source}
```

- **signature** — `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(key, salt ‖ path))` over everything after the signature segment: the exact byte sequence following `/{signature}`, leading `/` included, taken from the raw (still percent-encoded) request path. Signatures are emitted unpadded; the canonical padded form (one trailing `=`) is accepted, but non-canonical spellings (over-padding, variant final characters) are rejected, so each signature has exactly two accepted spellings. In dev mode the literal `insecure` is accepted (disabled by default in prod).
- **options** — ordered, `/`-separated `key:value` segments (see §3). Order is normalized before hashing into the cache key, so `f:opus/br:96` and `br:96/f:opus` yield the same variant.
- **source** — one of:
  - `plain/local://{path}` — file below `AP_LOCAL_ROOT` (URL-escaped path)
  - `plain/s3://{bucket}/{key}` — S3 object (URL-escaped key)
  - `plain/{https-url}` — an `https://` source, URL-escaped; subject to an allowlist. `http://` is refused
  - `enc/{base64url(source)}` — encoded form, avoids escaping headaches

### Local sources

`local://{path}` names a path relative to `AP_LOCAL_ROOT`. The root is deployment configuration and does not participate in identity: the canonical source string is `local://{path}` with no root in it, so the same relative path is the same variant however a deployment mounted it, and variants survive a root move.

When `AP_LOCAL_ROOT` is unset, local sources are disabled — the root *is* the allowlist for disk, so nothing mounted means nothing served.

Confinement is over *paths*, and uniform. After the source has been decoded exactly once (never before — a check on a half-decoded string proves nothing), the path must be relative, must not climb out of the root with `..`, and must still resolve inside the root once every symlink on it has been followed. A path that fails any of these is refused, never normalized and retried. Every refusal is **404**, the same status as a missing file: §5 has no 403, and a distinct status would turn the root into an existence oracle for the filesystem around it.

Two things sit outside a path-based check, and both are deployment assumptions rather than gaps the proxy can close: a **hardlink** inside the root pointing at an inode outside it is indistinguishable from an ordinary file, and the window between resolving a path and ffmpeg opening it (**TOCTOU**) allows a file to be swapped for a symlink. Both require write access to the root. **Mount the root read-only and do not let untrusted code write into it.**

Paths are bounded before resolution: at most 64 components and 1024 bytes, refused as 404. The bound is a denial-of-service control — the confinement primitive is superlinear in component count.

Metadata comes from the filesystem: regular files only (a directory, FIFO or device is a 404, as is a missing file), size checked against `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` for the 413, and size-plus-mtime as the ETag material behind conditional requests on `/info`.

### Remote sources

`s3://{bucket}/{key}` names an object; both halves are required, and the key is kept as its raw decoded bytes, since that is what S3 stores. `https://{host}/{path}` names a URL. Bounds are the stores' own: 63 bytes of bucket and 1024 of key (S3's maxima), 2048 bytes of URL and 253 of host (the de-facto URL maximum and DNS's name limit).

The canonical string for an HTTPS source folds every second *spelling* of one resource — case, a trailing root dot, an explicit `:443`, an absent path (rendered `/`), an empty query, any fragment, and an IP literal's spelling (`[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]` → `[::1]`) — because each survivor would buy one object a second cache key. It preserves the URL's own percent-encoding and its dot segments, because only the origin knows whether `a%2Fb` and `a/b`, or `a/../b` and `b`, are the same object. IP literals fold through strict parsing only: the lenient parser reads `01.2.3.4` as 1.2.3.4, and folding that would let one allowlist entry admit two subjects.

`http://` and userinfo (`https://user:pass@…`) are refused at the grammar rather than left to the allowlist, which keeps the allowlist single-axis: host, and nothing else.

`AP_SOURCE_ALLOWLIST` gates both forms. An entry is an exact name, a trailing-`*` prefix glob for buckets, a leading-`*.` label-anchored suffix glob for hosts, or a bare `*`; a `*` anywhere else matches nothing. Buckets match case-sensitively and hosts fold case, as S3 and DNS respectively do; an IP-literal host is matched bracketless. **Unset accepts S3 sources and refuses HTTPS ones** — bucket credentials are already a gate, an outbound fetch has none. A source failing the allowlist is the same **404** as a missing one.

Example:

```
/aG1hYy.../f:opus/br:96/t:12.5:30/fade:0.5:1/plain/s3://masters/2026/piece-final.wav
```

→ a 30-second Opus preview at 96 kbps, starting at 12.5 s, with a 0.5 s fade-in and 1 s fade-out.

## 2. Resources & endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /{sig}/{options}/{source}` | Rendered audio variant (the core resource) |
| `GET /{sig}/info/{source}` | Probe metadata as JSON (no processing options) |
| `GET /{sig}/f:peaks/…/{source}` | Waveform peaks (a *format*, not a separate resource — see §3.3) |
| `GET /health` | Liveness (unsigned) — `200` whatever the load; a busy proxy is a working proxy |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness (unsigned) — `200` while the node should receive new work, `503` once queue depth reaches `AP_READY_QUEUE_THRESHOLD`, recovering at half of it. Body: `{"status": "ready"\|"not_ready", "queued": n, "threshold": n}` |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics (unsigned, bind-address-restricted) — see below |
| `GET /hls/{sig}/{options}/{source}/index.m3u8` | **Reserved for v2** — segmented streaming |
| `GET /hls/{sig}/{options}/{source}/seg-{n}.m4s` | **Reserved for v2** |

**`/metrics` is on a listener of its own**, bound to `AP_METRICS_BIND:AP_METRICS_PORT` (default `127.0.0.1:9568`), and the main listener answers `404` for the path. The restriction is a bind rather than a peer-address check on the shared listener, because a bind is a guarantee the kernel makes: behind a proxy the peer address is the proxy's, and every check that reads one has to decide how much of `X-Forwarded-For` to believe. `AP_METRICS_BIND` takes an address literal and refuses a hostname — the access control of an unsigned endpoint must not depend on DNS. The response is `text/plain; version=0.0.4` and `no-store`; every label value is a bounded enum, so nothing a client sends can grow a scraper's series count.

**`/ready`'s `503` is a verdict, not an error**, and three consequences follow from that. Its body is `{"status", "queued", "threshold"}` rather than the `{"error", "message"}` envelope of §5 — a client generated from the error table must not expect that shape here. It carries no `Retry-After`, unlike the `429` that backpressure produces: a balancer reading this reroutes to another node immediately rather than waiting, so the header would be advice nobody acts on. And it reports live capacity numbers to an unsigned caller, which is deliberate — they are what make a failing probe diagnosable — but it does mean `/ready` is the one unsigned endpoint that discloses current load, and an operator who cares can strip the body at the edge without affecting the status.

No write endpoints in v1: variant write-back to S3 is a side effect of a GET render, not a client-facing API. Methods other than GET answer `404`, everywhere: the signed space is GET-only, and a `405` would confirm a route's shape without telling a client anything useful. The one exception is `OPTIONS` with `AP_ALLOW_ORIGIN` set, which answers the CORS preflight with `204`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD`, an echo of `Access-Control-Request-Headers` and `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400` — scoped to a deployment that has already named the origin it is answering, and confirming nothing that operator has not told that origin already. With the variable unset there is no preflight surface: `OPTIONS` is a `404` like every other method.

---

## 3. Processing options

Every option key belongs to one of two classes, and the class decides what the value is allowed to reach.

**Variant options** — §3.1 through §3.4 — describe the rendered bytes. They normalize into the canonical options string, which *is* the cache key, and they become ffmpeg arguments.

**Request options** — §3.5 — describe the request. They are parsed and validated in the options segment and covered by the signature like any other path bytes, but they are excluded from the canonical options string, the cache key and the ffmpeg arguments. Two URLs differing only in a request option are one variant: identical cache key, identical arguments, and concurrent requests for them coalesce into a single render.

That exclusion is what makes the class worth having. A per-recipient value inside the cache key would mint one render per recipient for byte-identical output, so the round-trip guarantee is stated per class: a variant option round-trips to an identical cache key, a request option round-trips to the signed path alone.

The rules that are not about the cache key hold for both classes. Unknown keys, repeated keys, empty segments and valueless segments are `422` whichever class a key belongs to.

### 3.1 Output format & encoding

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `f` | `mp3` `opus` `ogg` `aac` `m4a` `flac` `wav` `peaks` | `aac` = ADTS stream (streamable); `m4a` = fragmented MP4, cut on duration (`-movflags empty_moov+default_base_moof -frag_duration 1000000`) — `frag_keyframe` cuts at video keyframes, and audio has none, so it yields one fragment flushed at EOF; default `mp3` |
| `br` | integer, kbps | CBR/ABR bitrate for lossy formats |
| `q` | codec-specific number | VBR quality; mutually exclusive with `br`. The codec's own scale and range: mp3 0–9, ogg −1–10, aac/m4a 0.1–2, opus 0–10, flac 0–12 (the last two are `compression_level`). Out of range is a 422 — `f:flac/q:13` is rejected by ffmpeg itself |
| `sr` | Hz (`44100`, `48000`, …) | Resample; default: the source's rate. An explicit value above 48 kHz is refused for lossy formats |
| `ch` | `1` \| `2` | Downmix (defensible defaults: >2ch → 2) |
| `bd` | `16` \| `24` \| `32f` | Bit depth, lossless formats only; default: the source's depth, as `sr` defaults to its rate. `32f` is wav-only (flac encodes integers) |

**"The source's" means the probed source, not a stand-in.** Both defaults above are answered from the `ffprobe` gate described below, which runs on every miss anyway, so they are real rather than aspirational: `f:wav` on a 24-bit master returns 24-bit, and `f:flac` on a 96 kHz master returns 96 kHz. Where the probe cannot read a rate or a depth, the fallbacks are 48 kHz and 16-bit.

`norm` is the case worth stating outright, because it does resample and still honours that default. Single-pass `loudnorm` emits 192 kHz internally; the render resamples back to the source's rate to undo it, for every format. So `norm` changes the loudness of a variant and nothing else about it — `f:flac/norm:ebu` on a 96 kHz master is still 96 kHz.

**The 48 kHz lossy ceiling is a rule about the request, not about the output.** `sr:96000` with a lossy format is a `422`, because that is a rate a client may not *ask* for. It is not a cap on what a lossy render may return: a 96 kHz source rendered as `f:aac` or `f:m4a` without an `sr` comes back at 96 kHz, since the default is the source's rate for every format. The same source as `f:mp3` or `f:opus` comes back at 48 kHz, but that is those encoders accepting nothing higher rather than this proxy imposing a limit.

**Audio only, enforced rather than implied.** Every format above is audio, and so is every input this proxy accepts: a source carrying a genuine video stream is refused with `415`, by an `ffprobe` gate that runs before any render starts. It is a *reject*, not a strip — extracting the audio track from arbitrary video would make this a free transcoding service at video's cost profile and video's CVE exposure, which is a different product. Embedded cover art (an `attached_pic` stream, which virtually every tagged mp3, flac and m4a carries) is metadata, not video, and renders normally.

Two things hold underneath that gate, for every render and independently of it. The argv disables non-audio streams (`-vn -sn -dn`), and ffmpeg runs under a `-protocol_whitelist` derived from the resolved source's type: `file` for a local source, `https,tls,tcp` for a remote one (plus `http` only where a plaintext development endpoint is configured). The two sets are disjoint, so a local render cannot reach the network, a remote one cannot read the filesystem, and neither can reach `concat:`, `subfile:` or any other pivot. No processing option and no environment variable widens either — that is the point of deriving it from the source.

One consequence of the remote set carrying no `http`: an HTTPS origin that answers with a redirect to a cleartext URL fails to open, as a source error. That is the policy working rather than a gap — `http://` is not a scheme this proxy serves in the first place (§1) — but it is worth knowing before debugging a source whose origin downgrades on redirect.

The gate does not run on a cache hit, because a hit is immutable bytes that already passed it, and it does not run on `HEAD`, which spawns no subprocess at all. Both are stated here because they are the two ways a `200` can answer a URL whose `GET` on a miss would be a `415`.

### 3.2 Time-domain / preview

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `t` | `start[:duration]` seconds, decimals ok | Trim. `t:30` = from 30 s to end; `t:30:15` = 15 s from 30 s |
| `fade` | `in[:out]` seconds | Applied inside the trimmed region |
| `gain` | dB, signed | Static gain. Applies under `f:peaks` too |
| `norm` | `ebu[:I[:TP[:LRA]]]` | Loudness normalization via `loudnorm`; default `-16:-1.5:11`. Applies under `f:peaks` too. Forces a resample to the source's rate (see §3.1), because single-pass `loudnorm` emits 192 kHz. **Note:** proper two-pass loudnorm requires a full first pass — v1 does single-pass (good enough for previews), flag in docs |
| `enhance` | `voice` | A named enhancement preset: high-pass, denoise, de-ess, compress, limit, in that order, ahead of every stage above. The final limiter is what keeps the makeup gain from clipping a transient the compressor let through. Applies under `f:peaks` too, so a waveform matches the audio it is drawn under. Orthogonal to `norm` — the preset shapes dynamics, it does not hit a loudness target, and the two combine |

**A preset value is pinned to its chain, permanently.** `enhance:voice` maps to one exact filter chain, and that is the contract rather than an implementation detail: a variant is addressed by a key derived from the *name* and served `immutable`, so a chain that changed under a name would give two different renders one cache key — a CDN keeps serving the old bytes, a cold cache produces the new ones, and no part of the URL distinguishes them. An improved chain therefore ships as a **new value** (`voice2`), and `enhance:voice` renders the same bytes it always did. An unrecognized preset name is a `422`, which is what makes adding one a safe, additive change.

### 3.3 Peaks (`f:peaks`)

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pts` | integer | Number of min/max pairs (default 800) |
| `pk_fmt` | `json` \| `dat` | JSON or compact binary; both are [audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform)'s formats (default `json`) |
| `ch` | `1` \| `2` | **Default 1**, unlike every other format — peaks downmix rather than follow the source. `ch:2` gives per-channel pairs. The default is materialized into the cache key |

Peaks respect `t`, `ch`, `fade`, `enhance`, `gain` and `norm`: a waveform is drawn under the audio a listener hears, so anything that changes the samples changes the picture. The rule is exactly that question, and the options it refuses are the ones that cannot answer yes — `br`, `q` and `bd` are encoder settings and peaks are never encoded, and `sr` cannot move a pixel either, because bucket boundaries are a fraction of the total sample count rather than a duration. Each is a `422` naming the segment, rather than being ignored: an option that cannot change the output would hand one result two cache keys. Cheap enough to render eagerly alongside any audio variant later, but v1 renders on request.

Both serializations carry the same numbers: `version` 2, `channels`, `sample_rate`, `samples_per_pixel`, `bits` (always 16), `length` (always exactly `pts`), and `length × 2 × channels` signed 16-bit values — a minimum and a maximum per pixel per channel, interleaved. `pk_fmt:json` is `application/json` with those field names; `pk_fmt:dat` is `application/octet-stream`, a little-endian header of version, flags, sample rate, samples-per-pixel, length and channel count, then the values as `int16`.

Peaks are a *format*, so they participate in the cache key, the write-back and the HIT redirect exactly as audio variants do.

### 3.4 Delivery

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dl` | filename (URL-escaped) | Sets `Content-Disposition: attachment` |
| `cb` | opaque string | Cache-buster, participates in cache key |

### 3.5 Request options

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `exp` | integer, Unix seconds | The URL is refused with `410` from this second onwards. Bounded like every other integer option; a value in the past is valid grammar, not a `422` |

A signed URL is otherwise an eternal bearer capability: the HMAC covers the path and nothing else, so a leaked URL works forever and the only revocation is rotating the key, which kills every URL ever issued. `exp` time-boxes one URL without touching any other.

It needs no mechanism of its own to be tamper-proof: it sits in the path, so it is inside the signature, and altering or removing it is the same `401` as altering anything else.

**Which is why a request option is a path segment and not a query parameter**, the obvious-looking alternative for a value that is deliberately not part of the cache key. §1's signature covers the path alone, so `?exp=…` would be unsigned, and an unsigned expiry is no expiry: anyone holding the URL deletes the parameter. Signing the query string instead would mean canonicalizing it first — parameter order, repeated keys, encoding variants — which is the normalization problem the options grammar already solves, rebuilt in a second syntax, and it would change the signing input for every existing generator. The cache-key exclusion needs none of that: it is a property of which keys the canonical string is built from, not of where in the URL they sit.

Two things that argument does not claim. It does not extend to `/info`, which has no options segment and therefore cannot carry a request option at all — a signed query string genuinely would have covered both endpoints, and that is the cost of this decision rather than an oversight. And it says nothing about edge-cache efficiency: two URLs differing only in `exp` are distinct URLs whichever syntax carries them, so a CDN stores them separately either way. The single-render and single-variant guarantees are origin-side, held by the coalescing registry and the cache key.

**No clock-skew leeway.** A generator that wants a margin adds it to its own timestamps; leeway here would be a margin every deployment pays whether it wanted one or not. The boundary is exclusive — a request arriving in the second `exp` names is still served.

**A past timestamp parses.** `exp:1` is a well-formed URL whose answer is `410`, not a `422` about an invalid option. That distinction is what lets the `410` be a permanent, cacheable verdict rather than a parse error.

**Expiry caps every lifetime the response hands out** (§5): the `Cache-Control` `max-age` of a successful response, and the presigned TTL of a HIT redirect, are each clamped to at most `exp − now`. Without both, an expiring URL would leave behind a cached body or a storage credential that outlives it, and the `410` would be theater.

`/info` has no options segment (§2), so it cannot carry `exp`. Info URLs are operator-to-operator rather than shared with end users; extending the grammar is a separate change if demand appears.

---

## 4. `info` response

```json
{
  "format": "wav",
  "duration": 3612.44,
  "sample_rate": 96000,
  "channels": 4,
  "bit_depth": 24,
  "bitrate": 9216000,
  "size": 4161273856,
  "tags": { "title": "…", "artist": "…" }
}
```

Derived from `ffprobe -show_format -show_streams`, filtered to the fields above — the first audio stream is what the object describes. Every stream is requested rather than just `a:0` because the audio-only policy applies here too, and a gate cannot refuse a stream ffprobe was told to hide. `info` takes **no** processing options: any option segment alongside it is a `422`.

### 4.1 Field rules

The mapping is explicit rather than a passthrough, because ffprobe's output is verbose, version-dependent and inconsistent across containers while this object is none of those.

| Field | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | `format.format_name`, refined by `stream.codec_name` | Whichever name in ffprobe's comma-separated list is a §3.1 token, so the `mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2` family is `m4a` and Ogg is `opus` or `ogg` by codec. Membership, not the whole string: the list's contents and order are ffprobe's business and change between versions. A container §3.1 has no token for falls through to the first name (`matroska,webm` → `matroska`) — `format` describes the *source*, and a source may be in a container this proxy cannot emit |
| `duration` | `format.duration`, else `stream.duration` | Seconds, float |
| `sample_rate`, `channels` | the audio stream | Integers |
| `bit_depth` | `stream.bits_per_raw_sample`, else `stream.bits_per_sample` | Never `sample_fmt`: a lossy stream decodes to a float format and has no depth to report |
| `bitrate` | `format.bit_rate`, else `stream.bit_rate` | Integer, bits per second |
| `size` | the storage backend's `stat`, else `format.size` | The store is authoritative for the object |
| `tags` | `format.tags` | String-valued entries only, keys lowercased, capped in count and length. Arbitrary bytes from a file the operator may not control |

Each fallback is tried on the *extracted* value: ffprobe writes `"N/A"` rather than omitting a field it cannot answer, so taking the first key that is present would stop at the `"N/A"` and never reach the section that knows.

**A field ffprobe cannot answer is omitted, never `null` and never a zero standing in for "unknown".** `"bit_depth" in info` is therefore a true answer for every source. A source with no audio stream at all — a video-only MP4, a text file — is a `415`, not an object with everything missing.

The audio-only policy (§3.1) covers this endpoint as well: a source carrying a genuine video stream is `415` `video_source` here exactly as it is on a render, so the policy has no endpoint-shaped exception and `/info` is not a metadata-extraction service for arbitrary video. Cover art is not video, so a tagged mp3 with artwork is described normally. The check costs nothing extra — it reads the probe the endpoint had already run.

### 4.2 Caching

`ETag` is `hash(canonical-source ‖ source ETag)`: it changes exactly when the object does, and `If-None-Match` is answered `304` after the source `stat` and before the probe, which is the expensive half.

`Cache-Control` is `public, max-age=3600` — **not** `immutable`, unlike a variant's. A variant's URL describes its bytes completely, so it can never become stale; `/info` describes a *mutable* source, and the same URL answers differently after a re-upload. `immutable` there would tell caches never to revalidate a document that has no other way of being corrected. An hour plus a cheap `304` is the aggressive caching this endpoint can honestly offer. A backend with no ETag material to give gets `public, max-age=60` and no validator, since nothing could correct it early.

A `HEAD` answers what the check chain determines — `401`, `404`, `413` and the caching headers — and stops there, so it never spawns a probe and therefore answers `200` where a `GET` would answer `415`. That is the same discipline `HEAD` follows on the render endpoint, for the same reason: diagnosing `415` *is* the work `HEAD` exists to skip.

### 4.3 Cost

`AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` does **not** apply to `/info`, unlike every other signed request: a probe reads container headers and never decodes, so a source too large to *render* still costs a probe nothing to describe — and the client most in need of the endpoint is precisely the one holding a long source it means to ask a trimmed preview of.

A probe reads container headers and stops; it never decodes. It therefore does **not** take an `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` slot — that cap exists to bound encoders pinning cores, and queueing probes behind renders would make the endpoint a client calls *before* it knows what to request the slowest thing in the proxy. `AP_PROBE_TIMEOUT` is what bounds one probe's lifetime, and it is separate from and shorter than `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT`.

What a probe *does* take is a slot in a pool of its own, `AP_MAX_PROBE_CONCURRENCY`, which defaults to four times `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY`. There are two subprocess pools, and this is the second: renders are rationed by one counter and probes by another, so a probe never waits behind an encoder and neither pool is unbounded. A probe that finds no slot is answered `429` with `Retry-After`, the same shape a full render queue produces. There is no queue behind the probe ceiling — a probe is tens of milliseconds, so telling a client to come back is worth more than making it wait.

Probes coalesce on the **source**, not the variant: concurrent requests reading one source share one `ffprobe`, whether they are two `/info` calls, two different renditions of one file, or an `/info` alongside a render. Only a request that actually spawns a probe takes a slot, so the ceiling counts `ffprobe` processes rather than requests — exactly as `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` counts encoders rather than subscribers. A request served from the variant store, or answered `304`, probes not at all and takes nothing from either pool.

---

## 5. Response semantics

### Cache MISS (first request for a variant)

- `200 OK`, `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, no `Content-Length`, **no** `Accept-Ranges`.
- Bytes stream as the encoder produces them; simultaneously teed to the variant bucket (`s3://{variant-bucket}/{cache-key}`).
- Concurrent requests for the same cache key **coalesce**: one render, all clients subscribe to its chunk stream.
- Header: `X-Audio-Proxy: MISS` (or `COALESCED`).

### Cache HIT

Checked before coalescing and before the source is stat'd — a stored variant is immutable bytes that owe nothing to a source which may since have been deleted. Header: `X-Audio-Proxy: HIT`, in both modes.

**Redirect mode** (`AP_SERVE_MODE=redirect`, the default): `302` to a presigned URL for the variant object, valid for `AP_PRESIGN_TTL` seconds — or for `exp − now`, whichever is shorter (§3.5) — → S3/CDN serves `Accept-Ranges`, `206` and `Content-Length` natively and the proxy leaves the hot path. The redirect itself carries `Cache-Control: no-store`: its `Location` is a credential with an expiry, and a cached `302` hands out URLs that have already expired. The variant's own `Content-Type` and `Cache-Control` come from the store, which holds the ones the write-back saved — so a followed redirect delivers what a proxied HIT would have sent.

**Proxy mode** (`AP_SERVE_MODE=proxy`): the proxy serves the object itself — `200` with `Content-Length` and `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, relayed as it is read, so a declared length and progressive delivery are both true and the whole object is never resident. A `Range` is answered with `206` and `Content-Range`. A syntactically valid range no byte can satisfy is a `416` with `Content-Range: bytes */{size}` and `Cache-Control: no-store` — its body depends on a request header, and nothing here sends `Vary: Range`. Multi-range specs, non-`bytes` units and malformed values are ignored and answered with the whole variant, which RFC 9110 §14.2 permits; there is no `multipart/byteranges` response.

### Cache state changes the framing

The same URL is framed differently depending on what is cached, and clients must not assume one framing for a given URL:

| | MISS / COALESCED | HIT |
|---|---|---|
| Framing | `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` | `Content-Length` |
| `Accept-Ranges` | absent | `bytes` |
| `Range` | ignored | `206` / `416` |

Both begin delivering before the variant is complete or fully read. What a client observes is a property of the *cache state*, never of the configured backend or serve mode: the same signed URL against a `file://` deployment and an `s3://` one delivers the same bytes with the same `Content-Type`, `ETag` and `Cache-Control`, and is range-capable on a HIT either way. Backends differ in where the bytes come from, never in what a client must implement.

### HEAD

A `HEAD` on a signed endpoint answers the headers its `GET` would, with an empty body, and never renders: no subprocess, no render slot, no write-back, whatever the volume. It runs the same check chain — signature, `exp`, options, source authorization, the source stat — so a refusal is identical to the `GET`'s and reveals nothing about whether the variant exists. Which of its two shapes a client gets is the cache state:

| | HIT | MISS |
|---|---|---|
| Status | `200` (proxy mode) / `302` (redirect mode) | `200` |
| `X-Audio-Proxy` | `HIT` | `MISS` |
| `Content-Length` | the stored object's size | absent |
| `Accept-Ranges` | `bytes` | absent |
| `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`, `ETag` | as the `GET` | as the `GET` |

On a HIT the header set equals the `GET`'s, header for header — redirect mode included, where `Location` and its `Cache-Control: no-store` are mirrored. Nothing is omitted because nothing needs generating: the store's metadata answers all of it before a byte moves, and RFC 9110 §9.3.2 permits omitting only what is "determined only while generating the content".

On a MISS the two framing headers *are* determined only by rendering, so they are absent — the permitted omission, not an oversight. `Range` is not honoured on either shape.

**What a `HEAD` costs.** The cache lookup stands where the `GET`'s does, before the source stat, so a hit is answered from the variant store's metadata alone and never stats the source — cheaper than the old behavior, and the reason a hit can report a length at all. A miss pays for both: the store lookup that established the miss, then the stat. Against `s3://` on both sides that is two round trips where a `GET` on a miss also makes two, so a probe is never more expensive than the request it stands in for, but it is not free either. Nothing about it is counted in the cache hit ratio: those counters describe variants delivered, and a `HEAD` delivers none, so polling one cannot move the number an operator reads.

Where a `HEAD` still diverges from its `GET` is the statuses only a subprocess can discover. It neither decodes nor probes, so an undecodable source and one carrying video both answer `200` where the `GET` answers `415`: diagnosing that *is* the work a `HEAD` exists to skip.

### Common headers

`Content-Type` per format · `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable, no-transform` (URL encodes the variant, so it *is* immutable; `no-transform` because the bytes are the product and must survive edge features that recompress or mangle bodies) · `ETag` = cache key, sent quoted, since RFC 9110 defines an entity-tag as a quoted-string and a bare token is not one.

**Under `exp` (§3.5) the `max-age` is clamped** to at most `exp − now` on every successful response — the MISS, the HIT and the `304` alike — while the rest of the header is unchanged. The value *stored* with the variant is never clamped: those bytes are shared by every `exp`, so the cached policy stays the full year and a HIT clamps on the way out. A HIT redirect's presigned `Location` is clamped to the same bound, and by the sharper argument: following it needs no signature of this proxy's, so a credential outliving its URL has left the building entirely.

### Edge-cache discipline

Every response, success or error, carries an explicit `Cache-Control` — no CDN negative-caching default ever decides retention:

- Errors: `404`/`413`/`415` → `max-age=10` (verdicts about the current source bytes; a re-upload changes them), `401`/`422` → `max-age=60` (pure functions of the URL; only a deploy changes them), `410` → `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (see §3.5 — the one verdict a deploy cannot change either), `416`/`429`/`5xx` → `no-store` (transient, or — for `416` — dependent on a request header no `Vary` declares). The `502` row inherits that rather than inventing it, and the inheritance is the point: a store outage is exactly the failure that must not be cached, since the retry it suppresses is the one that would have worked. `/health`, `/ready` and the unmatched-route `404` state theirs too (`no-store`, `no-store` and `max-age=10`).
- **Conditional requests**: an `If-None-Match` matching the URL-derived `ETag` answers `304` with `ETag` and `Cache-Control`, no body, no render, no storage access. Placed after signature verification — never an existence oracle for unsigned probes.
- **HEAD** answers the `GET`'s headers bodilessly and renders nothing, in the two shapes stated under *HEAD* above. Errors as `GET`, bodiless.
- **Range on a MISS is ignored**: the full `200` chunked stream, no `Accept-Ranges`, no `206`/`416` (RFC 9110 §14.2 permits ignoring `Range`). `206` semantics belong to cached variants — served by the proxy or by storage, per the serve mode.

### Errors (JSON body)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `401` | Invalid/missing signature |
| `404` | Source not found / not readable |
| `413` | Source exceeds `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` |
| `415` | Source not decodable (`undecodable_source`), or contains video (`video_source` — see §3.1) |
| `410` | The URL's `exp` has passed (`expired`, §3.5). Checked after signature verification and before source resolution, so an expired URL reaches no storage and spawns no subprocess |
| `416` | `Range` unsatisfiable against a cached variant (proxy mode only) |
| `422` | Invalid or conflicting options |
| `429` | No slot in one of the two pools: either no render slot (the wait queue was full, or this request waited in it longer than `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` without reaching the front) or no probe slot (`AP_MAX_PROBE_CONCURRENCY` reached, §4.3 — that pool has no queue). `Retry-After` set either way, and which pool it was is deliberately not reported |
| `500` | The render failed for a reason that is not the client's: no encoder, no space, a diagnostic the classifier does not recognise |
| `500` | The storage backend a source names is misconfigured: no credentials, or a store that answers a redirect because the configured region or endpoint is not the object's. No client action can resolve either |
| `502` | The storage backend could not be reached: a transport failure, or a `5xx` from the store itself |
| `504` | A render started and then exceeded `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` |

`410` is not a signature complaint, and saying `401` would send a client looking for a key problem it does not have: the signature verified, and the URL simply has a time on it. It is also the one error row whose verdict is permanent by construction — the timestamp is inside the signature, so no later request can make this URL valid — which is why it carries a year of `immutable` rather than the seconds-to-a-minute the other rows do. An edge answering it outright *is* the enforcement.

The two `415`s are separate `error` values on one status because they are different verdicts: `undecodable_source` says the bytes could not be read, `video_source` says they were read and refused. A client told "not decodable" about a file every player opens would go looking for a corrupt upload.

That makes `415` the one status that discriminates between *contents*, which is a deliberate exception to the blindness the `404` row enforces — and it is sound only because of where it sits. Signature verification precedes it, so the answer is available exclusively to someone the operator already handed a URL for this exact source; and `415` at all (rather than `404`) already discloses that the source exists and is readable. Splitting "missing" from "unauthorized" was rejected for the opposite reason: those answers are reachable by anyone who can guess a path.

`probe_failed` (`500`) and `probe_timeout` (`504`) are two rows of their own rather than a reuse of the render pair. The bodies name the limit an operator would raise, and `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` is not that limit for a probe; an error naming the wrong variable sends them to the wrong place. Both are reachable **on either endpoint**: `/info` is a probe, and a render probes too before it starts (§3.1's audio-only gate), so a render URL answering `504 probe_timeout` means the gate's probe ran out of `AP_PROBE_TIMEOUT` before any encoding began.

Every other row is something the *client* got wrong, which is why `500` and `502` are worth stating rather than leaving to the adapter: a render can fail with none of them true, and answering a plausible `4xx` would tell a client to stop retrying something that might well work next time.

`502` is deliberately not the `404`. That row is blind on purpose, so no source failure can be used to probe what exists — but an outage is not a source failure. It says nothing about whether the object is there, and routing it into the `404` tells a client its object is gone when the store is merely unreachable: a deletion reported that did not happen, then cached for the ten seconds that row carries, suppressing the retry that would have worked. A store that answers `5xx` or does not answer at all is `502`; a store that says "no such object" — and one that refuses the credential, which stays indistinguishable from that by design — is the `404`.

`429` and `504` divide on whether a render ever ran, not on how long the client waited — both can take the full `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT`. A request that spent that budget queued for a slot has nothing to report about a render, so it is told to come back, with the same `Retry-After` a full queue would have given it up front. `504` means a render held a slot and then went silent. Answering `504` for a wait would name a timeout that never happened, and would tell a client its variant is too expensive to encode when the truth is that the box is busy.

Mid-stream render failure after `200` is signaled by abnormal termination of the chunked stream (nothing better exists over plain HTTP; one more argument for HLS in v2).

## 6. Configuration (env)

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AP_KEY`, `AP_SALT` | Hex-encoded HMAC key/salt; key must decode to ≥ 32 bytes (generate: `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `AP_ALLOW_INSECURE` | Accept unsigned URLs (dev only) |
| `AP_SOURCE_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated bucket/host patterns; unset accepts every bucket and refuses every host (§1) |
| `AP_LOCAL_ROOT` | Root directory for `local://` sources; unset = local sources disabled. Must exist at boot |
| `AP_VARIANT_STORE` | Variant store, scheme-tagged: `file:///path` or `s3://bucket`; unset = no cache, always render. Either scheme is proved writable at boot by performing a write and removing it — a directory that does not exist or refuses writes, or a bucket that is unreachable or refuses one, fails the container. `s3://` names a bucket only — a key prefix, a port or embedded credentials are refused rather than ignored |
| `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | Max simultaneous ffmpeg processes (default: CPU count). Coalesced requests share one, so this counts renders and not requests |
| `AP_MAX_PROBE_CONCURRENCY` | Max simultaneous ffprobe processes (default: 4 × `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY`). A pool of its own so a probe never waits behind an encoder; concurrent requests for one source share a probe, so this counts probes and not requests. No queue — overflow is `429` — see §4.3 |
| `AP_QUEUE_SIZE` | Requests that may wait for a *render* slot before the next is answered `429` |
| `AP_READY_QUEUE_THRESHOLD` | Queue depth at which `/ready` answers `503`, recovering at half of it rounded down (default: half `AP_QUEUE_SIZE` rounded down, minimum 1; `0` disables, as does `AP_QUEUE_SIZE=0`). Refused above `AP_QUEUE_SIZE`, where it could never trip |
| `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES`, `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` | Abuse limits. `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` bounds the *source*, checked before a render starts — the `413` above |
| `AP_MAX_VARIANT_BYTES` | Bytes one render may retain, defaulting to the effective `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES`. Output past it kills the render; the response has already committed to `200`, so the outcome is a failed stream rather than a `413` |
| `AP_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | Seconds an `/info` probe may take before ffprobe is killed and the request answered `504` (default: 10). Separate from `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` because a probe reads headers rather than decoding — see §4.3 |
| `AP_SERVE_MODE` | `redirect` \| `proxy` |
| `AP_PRESIGN_TTL` | Seconds a HIT's presigned URL stays valid (default: 300); redirect mode only |
| `AP_LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warning` \| `error` (default: `info`) |
| `AP_METRICS_BIND`, `AP_METRICS_PORT` | Where the `/metrics` listener binds (default: `127.0.0.1`, `9568`). The endpoint is unsigned, so the bind is its access control; `AP_METRICS_BIND` is an address literal and a hostname is refused at boot, as is a port equal to the listener's |
| `AP_S3_ENDPOINT` | Origin URL of an S3-compatible store (`http://minio:9000`); unset = AWS proper. An origin and nothing else — a path, query, fragment or embedded credentials are refused at boot |
| `AP_S3_ADDRESSING` | `virtual` \| `path`: whether a request names its bucket in the host or in the path. Default: `virtual` with no `AP_S3_ENDPOINT`, `path` with one. Signed requests and presigned URLs always use the same style, since the host is inside the signature |
| `AP_ALLOW_ORIGIN` | `*` or one origin (`https://app.example.com`); unset = no CORS headers at all, which is what a plain `<audio src>` needs and nothing more. Set, every main-listener response carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: x-audio-proxy, retry-after, accept-ranges, etag` and — for a named origin — `Vary: Origin`, and `OPTIONS` answers the preflight in §2. An origin and nothing else, in the spelling a browser uses — the header is compared to `Origin` byte for byte, so a path, query, fragment or credentials are refused at boot, and so is any near-miss that could never match: a trailing slash, an uppercase scheme or host, a trailing dot, an explicitly written default port. The error carries the canonical spelling |
| `AP_S3_CA_BUNDLE` | PEM bundle to verify the store's certificate against, replacing the system trust store; a readable file at boot. There is no way to disable verification |
| `AP_VARIANT_S3_ENDPOINT`, `AP_VARIANT_S3_ADDRESSING`, `AP_VARIANT_S3_CA_BUNDLE` | The three above, for the variant store alone. Each falls back to its shared counterpart when unset; `AP_VARIANT_S3_ADDRESSING` derives from `AP_VARIANT_S3_ENDPOINT` when *that* is set, and otherwise inherits the effective shared style |
| `AP_VARIANT_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AP_VARIANT_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AP_VARIANT_S3_REGION`, `AP_VARIANT_S3_SESSION_TOKEN` | The variant store's own identity, falling back to the `AWS_*` credentials when none of them is set. All-or-nothing: setting a strict subset of the first three aborts boot naming those missing. The session token stays optional and follows the identity rather than the variable — inherited with the rest of the source identity when none of the group is set, and read from `AP_VARIANT_S3_SESSION_TOKEN` alone once the store has one of its own, since a token belongs to the principal that minted it |

S3 credentials are the exception to the `AP_` rule and keep the standard AWS names — `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` and `AWS_REGION` (or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`) — validated as a group at boot: all of key, secret and region, or none. There is no IMDS or STS lookup, so credentials come from the environment or not at all.

Those variables configure two jobs — fetching sources and running the variant store — and the `AP_VARIANT_S3_*` group above splits the second off, for a deployment whose cache lives on another provider or answers to another principal. Every variant-store request runs under it: the boot writability probe, HIT lookups, write-back, and the presigned URL a `302` carries. That last one is correctness rather than tidiness, since the host and the credential are both inside a SigV4 signature. With none of the group set the two configurations are identical and behavior is exactly as it was before the group existed.

Redirect serving is a *capability of the store's backend*: `redirect` answers a HIT with a 302 to a presigned variant URL, which only a backend that can presign (`s3://`) can produce. `AP_SERVE_MODE=redirect` against a store without that capability (`file://`) is refused at boot, with an error naming both variables — never per request.
