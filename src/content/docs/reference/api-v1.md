title: "Audio Proxy — API v1 (draft)"
---

:::note
Synced from [`audioproxy@4e37081`](https://github.com/audioproxy/audioproxy/blob/4e37081/docs/audio-proxy-api-v1.md) — that repo is canonical; edit there, then re-run `bin/sync-proxy-docs`.
:::

An imgproxy-style on-the-fly audio transcoding proxy. Sources live in S3 (or any HTTP-reachable store); variants are rendered on demand, streamed to the first requester, and written back to a variant bucket for cached, range-capable serving thereafter.

Design principles, in order: URLs are the entire API (no request bodies, no state); every variant is fully described by its processing options, which double as the cache key; everything is signed.

---

## 1. URL structure

```
GET /{signature}/{options}/{source}
```

- **signature** — `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(key, salt ‖ path))` over everything after the signature segment: the exact byte sequence following `/{signature}`, leading `/` included, taken from the raw (still percent-encoded) request path. Signatures are emitted unpadded; the canonical padded form (one trailing `=`) is accepted, but non-canonical spellings (over-padding, variant final characters) are rejected, so each signature has exactly two accepted spellings. In dev mode the literal `insecure` is accepted (disabled by default in prod).
- **options** — ordered, `/`-separated `key:value` segments (see §3). Order is normalized before hashing into the cache key, so `f:opus/br:96` and `br:96/f:opus` yield the same variant.
- **source** — one of:
  - `plain/local://{path}` — file below `AP_LOCAL_ROOT` (URL-escaped path)
  - `plain/s3://{bucket}/{key}` — S3 object (URL-escaped key)
  - `plain/{https-url}` — an `https://` source, URL-escaped; subject to an allowlist. `http://` is refused
  - `enc/{base64url(source)}` — encoded form, avoids escaping headaches

### Local sources

`local://{path}` names a path relative to `AP_LOCAL_ROOT`. The root is deployment configuration and does not participate in identity: the canonical source string is `local://{path}` with no root in it, so the same relative path is the same variant however a deployment mounted it, and variants survive a root move.

When `AP_LOCAL_ROOT` is unset, local sources are disabled — the root *is* the allowlist for disk, so nothing mounted means nothing served.

Confinement is over *paths*, and uniform. After the source has been decoded exactly once (never before — a check on a half-decoded string proves nothing), the path must be relative, must not climb out of the root with `..`, and must still resolve inside the root once every symlink on it has been followed. A path that fails any of these is refused, never normalized and retried. Every refusal is **404**, the same status as a missing file: §5 has no 403, and a distinct status would turn the root into an existence oracle for the filesystem around it.

Two things sit outside a path-based check, and both are deployment assumptions rather than gaps the proxy can close: a **hardlink** inside the root pointing at an inode outside it is indistinguishable from an ordinary file, and the window between resolving a path and ffmpeg opening it (**TOCTOU**) allows a file to be swapped for a symlink. Both require write access to the root. **Mount the root read-only and do not let untrusted code write into it.**

Paths are bounded before resolution: at most 64 components and 1024 bytes, refused as 404. The bound is a denial-of-service control — the confinement primitive is superlinear in component count.

Metadata comes from the filesystem: regular files only (a directory, FIFO or device is a 404, as is a missing file), size checked against `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` for the 413, and size-plus-mtime as the ETag material behind conditional requests on `/info`.

### Remote sources

`s3://{bucket}/{key}` names an object; both halves are required, and the key is kept as its raw decoded bytes, since that is what S3 stores. `https://{host}/{path}` names a URL. Bounds are the stores' own: 63 bytes of bucket and 1024 of key (S3's maxima), 2048 bytes of URL and 253 of host (the de-facto URL maximum and DNS's name limit).

The canonical string for an HTTPS source folds every second *spelling* of one resource — case, a trailing root dot, an explicit `:443`, an absent path (rendered `/`), an empty query, any fragment, and an IP literal's spelling (`[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]` → `[::1]`) — because each survivor would buy one object a second cache key. It preserves the URL's own percent-encoding and its dot segments, because only the origin knows whether `a%2Fb` and `a/b`, or `a/../b` and `b`, are the same object. IP literals fold through strict parsing only: the lenient parser reads `01.2.3.4` as 1.2.3.4, and folding that would let one allowlist entry admit two subjects.

`http://` and userinfo (`https://user:pass@…`) are refused at the grammar rather than left to the allowlist, which keeps the allowlist single-axis: host, and nothing else.

`AP_SOURCE_ALLOWLIST` gates both forms. An entry is an exact name, a trailing-`*` prefix glob for buckets, a leading-`*.` label-anchored suffix glob for hosts, or a bare `*`; a `*` anywhere else matches nothing. Buckets match case-sensitively and hosts fold case, as S3 and DNS respectively do; an IP-literal host is matched bracketless. **Unset accepts S3 sources and refuses HTTPS ones** — bucket credentials are already a gate, an outbound fetch has none. A source failing the allowlist is the same **404** as a missing one.

Example:

```
/aG1hYy.../f:opus/br:96/t:12.5:30/fade:0.5:1/plain/s3://masters/2026/piece-final.wav
```

→ a 30-second Opus preview at 96 kbps, starting at 12.5 s, with a 0.5 s fade-in and 1 s fade-out.

## 2. Resources & endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /{sig}/{options}/{source}` | Rendered audio variant (the core resource) |
| `GET /{sig}/info/{source}` | Probe metadata as JSON (no processing options) |
| `GET /{sig}/f:peaks/…/{source}` | Waveform peaks (a *format*, not a separate resource — see §3.3) |
| `GET /health` | Liveness (unsigned) — `200` whatever the load; a busy proxy is a working proxy |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness (unsigned) — `200` while the node should receive new work, `503` once queue depth reaches `AP_READY_QUEUE_THRESHOLD`, recovering at half of it. Body: `{"status": "ready"\|"not_ready", "queued": n, "threshold": n}` |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics (unsigned, bind-address-restricted) — see below |
| `GET /hls/{sig}/{options}/{source}/index.m3u8` | **Reserved for v2** — segmented streaming |
| `GET /hls/{sig}/{options}/{source}/seg-{n}.m4s` | **Reserved for v2** |

**`/metrics` is on a listener of its own**, bound to `AP_METRICS_BIND:AP_METRICS_PORT` (default `127.0.0.1:9568`), and the main listener answers `404` for the path. The restriction is a bind rather than a peer-address check on the shared listener, because a bind is a guarantee the kernel makes: behind a proxy the peer address is the proxy's, and every check that reads one has to decide how much of `X-Forwarded-For` to believe. `AP_METRICS_BIND` takes an address literal and refuses a hostname — the access control of an unsigned endpoint must not depend on DNS. The response is `text/plain; version=0.0.4` and `no-store`; every label value is a bounded enum, so nothing a client sends can grow a scraper's series count.

**`/ready`'s `503` is a verdict, not an error**, and three consequences follow from that. Its body is `{"status", "queued", "threshold"}` rather than the `{"error", "message"}` envelope of §5 — a client generated from the error table must not expect that shape here. It carries no `Retry-After`, unlike the `429` that backpressure produces: a balancer reading this reroutes to another node immediately rather than waiting, so the header would be advice nobody acts on. And it reports live capacity numbers to an unsigned caller, which is deliberate — they are what make a failing probe diagnosable — but it does mean `/ready` is the one unsigned endpoint that discloses current load, and an operator who cares can strip the body at the edge without affecting the status.

No write endpoints in v1: variant write-back to S3 is a side effect of a GET render, not a client-facing API. Methods other than GET answer `404`, everywhere: the signed space is GET-only, and a `405` would confirm a route's shape without telling a client anything useful.

## 3. Processing options

### 3.1 Output format & encoding

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `f` | `mp3` `opus` `ogg` `aac` `m4a` `flac` `wav` `peaks` | `aac` = ADTS stream (streamable); `m4a` = fragmented MP4, cut on duration (`-movflags empty_moov+default_base_moof -frag_duration 1000000`) — `frag_keyframe` cuts at video keyframes, and audio has none, so it yields one fragment flushed at EOF; default `mp3` |
| `br` | integer, kbps | CBR/ABR bitrate for lossy formats |
| `q` | codec-specific number | VBR quality; mutually exclusive with `br`. The codec's own scale and range: mp3 0–9, ogg −1–10, aac/m4a 0.1–2, opus 0–10, flac 0–12 (the last two are `compression_level`). Out of range is a 422 — `f:flac/q:13` is rejected by ffmpeg itself |
| `sr` | Hz (`44100`, `48000`, …) | Resample; default: source rate, capped at 48 kHz for lossy |
| `ch` | `1` \| `2` | Downmix (defensible defaults: >2ch → 2) |
| `bd` | `16` \| `24` \| `32f` | Bit depth, lossless formats only; default: the source's depth, as `sr` defaults to its rate. `32f` is wav-only (flac encodes integers) |

**Audio only, enforced rather than implied.** Every format above is audio, and so is every input this proxy accepts: a source carrying a genuine video stream is refused with `415`, by an `ffprobe` gate that runs before any render starts. It is a *reject*, not a strip — extracting the audio track from arbitrary video would make this a free transcoding service at video's cost profile and video's CVE exposure, which is a different product. Embedded cover art (an `attached_pic` stream, which virtually every tagged mp3, flac and m4a carries) is metadata, not video, and renders normally.

Two things hold underneath that gate, for every render and independently of it. The argv disables non-audio streams (`-vn -sn -dn`), and ffmpeg runs under a `-protocol_whitelist` derived from the resolved source's type: `file` for a local source, `https,tls,tcp` for a remote one (plus `http` only where a plaintext development endpoint is configured). The two sets are disjoint, so a local render cannot reach the network, a remote one cannot read the filesystem, and neither can reach `concat:`, `subfile:` or any other pivot. No processing option and no environment variable widens either — that is the point of deriving it from the source.

One consequence of the remote set carrying no `http`: an HTTPS origin that answers with a redirect to a cleartext URL fails to open, as a source error. That is the policy working rather than a gap — `http://` is not a scheme this proxy serves in the first place (§1) — but it is worth knowing before debugging a source whose origin downgrades on redirect.

The gate does not run on a cache hit, because a hit is immutable bytes that already passed it, and it does not run on `HEAD`, which spawns no subprocess at all. Both are stated here because they are the two ways a `200` can answer a URL whose `GET` on a miss would be a `415`.

### 3.2 Time-domain / preview

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `t` | `start[:duration]` seconds, decimals ok | Trim. `t:30` = from 30 s to end; `t:30:15` = 15 s from 30 s |
| `fade` | `in[:out]` seconds | Applied inside the trimmed region |
| `gain` | dB, signed | Static gain |
| `norm` | `ebu[:I[:TP[:LRA]]]` | Loudness normalization via `loudnorm`; default `-16:-1.5:11`. **Note:** proper two-pass loudnorm requires a full first pass — v1 does single-pass (good enough for previews), flag in docs |

### 3.3 Peaks (`f:peaks`)

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pts` | integer | Number of min/max pairs (default 800) |
| `pk_fmt` | `json` \| `dat` | JSON or compact binary; both are [audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform)'s formats (default `json`) |
| `ch` | `1` \| `2` | **Default 1**, unlike every other format — peaks downmix rather than follow the source. `ch:2` gives per-channel pairs. The default is materialized into the cache key |

Peaks respect `t`, `ch` and `fade`, ignore encoding options. Cheap enough to render eagerly alongside any audio variant later, but v1 renders on request.

Both serializations carry the same numbers: `version` 2, `channels`, `sample_rate`, `samples_per_pixel`, `bits` (always 16), `length` (always exactly `pts`), and `length × 2 × channels` signed 16-bit values — a minimum and a maximum per pixel per channel, interleaved. `pk_fmt:json` is `application/json` with those field names; `pk_fmt:dat` is `application/octet-stream`, a little-endian header of version, flags, sample rate, samples-per-pixel, length and channel count, then the values as `int16`.

Peaks are a *format*, so they participate in the cache key, the write-back and the HIT redirect exactly as audio variants do.

### 3.4 Delivery

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dl` | filename (URL-escaped) | Sets `Content-Disposition: attachment` |
| `cb` | opaque string | Cache-buster, participates in cache key |

---

## 4. `info` response

```json
{
  "format": "wav",
  "duration": 3612.44,
  "sample_rate": 96000,
  "channels": 4,
  "bit_depth": 24,
  "bitrate": 9216000,
  "size": 4161273856,
  "tags": { "title": "…", "artist": "…" }
}
```

Derived from `ffprobe -show_format -show_streams`, filtered to the fields above — the first audio stream is what the object describes. Every stream is requested rather than just `a:0` because the audio-only policy applies here too, and a gate cannot refuse a stream ffprobe was told to hide. `info` takes **no** processing options: any option segment alongside it is a `422`.

### 4.1 Field rules

The mapping is explicit rather than a passthrough, because ffprobe's output is verbose, version-dependent and inconsistent across containers while this object is none of those.

| Field | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | `format.format_name`, refined by `stream.codec_name` | Whichever name in ffprobe's comma-separated list is a §3.1 token, so the `mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2` family is `m4a` and Ogg is `opus` or `ogg` by codec. Membership, not the whole string: the list's contents and order are ffprobe's business and change between versions. A container §3.1 has no token for falls through to the first name (`matroska,webm` → `matroska`) — `format` describes the *source*, and a source may be in a container this proxy cannot emit |
| `duration` | `format.duration`, else `stream.duration` | Seconds, float |
| `sample_rate`, `channels` | the audio stream | Integers |
| `bit_depth` | `stream.bits_per_raw_sample`, else `stream.bits_per_sample` | Never `sample_fmt`: a lossy stream decodes to a float format and has no depth to report |
| `bitrate` | `format.bit_rate`, else `stream.bit_rate` | Integer, bits per second |
| `size` | the storage backend's `stat`, else `format.size` | The store is authoritative for the object |
| `tags` | `format.tags` | String-valued entries only, keys lowercased, capped in count and length. Arbitrary bytes from a file the operator may not control |

Each fallback is tried on the *extracted* value: ffprobe writes `"N/A"` rather than omitting a field it cannot answer, so taking the first key that is present would stop at the `"N/A"` and never reach the section that knows.

**A field ffprobe cannot answer is omitted, never `null` and never a zero standing in for "unknown".** `"bit_depth" in info` is therefore a true answer for every source. A source with no audio stream at all — a video-only MP4, a text file — is a `415`, not an object with everything missing.

The audio-only policy (§3.1) covers this endpoint as well: a source carrying a genuine video stream is `415` `video_source` here exactly as it is on a render, so the policy has no endpoint-shaped exception and `/info` is not a metadata-extraction service for arbitrary video. Cover art is not video, so a tagged mp3 with artwork is described normally. The check costs nothing extra — it reads the probe the endpoint had already run.

### 4.2 Caching

`ETag` is `hash(canonical-source ‖ source ETag)`: it changes exactly when the object does, and `If-None-Match` is answered `304` after the source `stat` and before the probe, which is the expensive half.

`Cache-Control` is `public, max-age=3600` — **not** `immutable`, unlike a variant's. A variant's URL describes its bytes completely, so it can never become stale; `/info` describes a *mutable* source, and the same URL answers differently after a re-upload. `immutable` there would tell caches never to revalidate a document that has no other way of being corrected. An hour plus a cheap `304` is the aggressive caching this endpoint can honestly offer. A backend with no ETag material to give gets `public, max-age=60` and no validator, since nothing could correct it early.

A `HEAD` answers what the check chain determines — `401`, `404`, `413` and the caching headers — and stops there, so it never spawns a probe and therefore answers `200` where a `GET` would answer `415`. That is the same discipline `HEAD` follows on the render endpoint, for the same reason: diagnosing `415` *is* the work `HEAD` exists to skip.

### 4.3 Cost

`AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` does **not** apply to `/info`, unlike every other signed request: a probe reads container headers and never decodes, so a source too large to *render* still costs a probe nothing to describe — and the client most in need of the endpoint is precisely the one holding a long source it means to ask a trimmed preview of.

A probe reads container headers and stops; it never decodes. It therefore does **not** take an `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` slot — that cap exists to bound encoders pinning cores, and queueing probes behind renders would make the endpoint a client calls *before* it knows what to request the slowest thing in the proxy. `AP_PROBE_TIMEOUT` is what bounds one probe's lifetime, and it is separate from and shorter than `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT`.

What a probe *does* take is a slot in a pool of its own, `AP_MAX_PROBE_CONCURRENCY`, which defaults to four times `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY`. There are two subprocess pools, and this is the second: renders are rationed by one counter and probes by another, so a probe never waits behind an encoder and neither pool is unbounded. A probe that finds no slot is answered `429` with `Retry-After`, the same shape a full render queue produces. There is no queue behind the probe ceiling — a probe is tens of milliseconds, so telling a client to come back is worth more than making it wait.

Probes coalesce on the **source**, not the variant: concurrent requests reading one source share one `ffprobe`, whether they are two `/info` calls, two different renditions of one file, or an `/info` alongside a render. Only a request that actually spawns a probe takes a slot, so the ceiling counts `ffprobe` processes rather than requests — exactly as `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` counts encoders rather than subscribers. A request served from the variant store, or answered `304`, probes not at all and takes nothing from either pool.

---

## 5. Response semantics

### Cache MISS (first request for a variant)

- `200 OK`, `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, no `Content-Length`, **no** `Accept-Ranges`.
- Bytes stream as the encoder produces them; simultaneously teed to the variant bucket (`s3://{variant-bucket}/{cache-key}`).
- Concurrent requests for the same cache key **coalesce**: one render, all clients subscribe to its chunk stream.
- Header: `X-Audio-Proxy: MISS` (or `COALESCED`).

### Cache HIT

Checked before coalescing and before the source is stat'd — a stored variant is immutable bytes that owe nothing to a source which may since have been deleted. Header: `X-Audio-Proxy: HIT`, in both modes.

**Redirect mode** (`AP_SERVE_MODE=redirect`, the default): `302` to a presigned URL for the variant object, valid for `AP_PRESIGN_TTL` seconds → S3/CDN serves `Accept-Ranges`, `206` and `Content-Length` natively and the proxy leaves the hot path. The redirect itself carries `Cache-Control: no-store`: its `Location` is a credential with an expiry, and a cached `302` hands out URLs that have already expired. The variant's own `Content-Type` and `Cache-Control` come from the store, which holds the ones the write-back saved — so a followed redirect delivers what a proxied HIT would have sent.

**Proxy mode** (`AP_SERVE_MODE=proxy`): the proxy serves the object itself — `200` with `Content-Length` and `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, relayed as it is read, so a declared length and progressive delivery are both true and the whole object is never resident. A `Range` is answered with `206` and `Content-Range`. A syntactically valid range no byte can satisfy is a `416` with `Content-Range: bytes */{size}` and `Cache-Control: no-store` — its body depends on a request header, and nothing here sends `Vary: Range`. Multi-range specs, non-`bytes` units and malformed values are ignored and answered with the whole variant, which RFC 9110 §14.2 permits; there is no `multipart/byteranges` response.

### Cache state changes the framing

The same URL is framed differently depending on what is cached, and clients must not assume one framing for a given URL:

| | MISS / COALESCED | HIT |
|---|---|---|
| Framing | `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` | `Content-Length` |
| `Accept-Ranges` | absent | `bytes` |
| `Range` | ignored | `206` / `416` |

Both begin delivering before the variant is complete or fully read. What a client observes is a property of the *cache state*, never of the configured backend or serve mode: the same signed URL against a `file://` deployment and an `s3://` one delivers the same bytes with the same `Content-Type`, `ETag` and `Cache-Control`, and is range-capable on a HIT either way. Backends differ in where the bytes come from, never in what a client must implement.

### Common headers

`Content-Type` per format · `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable, no-transform` (URL encodes the variant, so it *is* immutable; `no-transform` because the bytes are the product and must survive edge features that recompress or mangle bodies) · `ETag` = cache key, sent quoted, since RFC 9110 defines an entity-tag as a quoted-string and a bare token is not one.

### Edge-cache discipline

Every response, success or error, carries an explicit `Cache-Control` — no CDN negative-caching default ever decides retention:

- Errors: `404`/`413`/`415` → `max-age=10` (verdicts about the current source bytes; a re-upload changes them), `401`/`422` → `max-age=60` (pure functions of the URL; only a deploy changes them), `416`/`429`/`5xx` → `no-store` (transient, or — for `416` — dependent on a request header no `Vary` declares). The `502` row inherits that rather than inventing it, and the inheritance is the point: a store outage is exactly the failure that must not be cached, since the retry it suppresses is the one that would have worked. `/health`, `/ready` and the unmatched-route `404` state theirs too (`no-store`, `no-store` and `max-age=10`).
- **Conditional requests**: an `If-None-Match` matching the URL-derived `ETag` answers `304` with `ETag` and `Cache-Control`, no body, no render, no storage access. Placed after signature verification — never an existence oracle for unsigned probes.
- **HEAD** on signed endpoints answers the status and headers a `GET` would, through the full check chain including the source stat, with an empty body and no render subprocess. Errors as `GET`, bodiless. No `X-Audio-Proxy`: that header reports a render's outcome, and none ran. It deliberately does **not** consult the variant cache, so it reports the render path's framing even where a `GET` would answer a HIT's, or a `302`; making HEAD the one request whose answer depends on cache state would invite clients to build on exactly what the framing contract above tells them not to.
- **Range on a MISS is ignored**: the full `200` chunked stream, no `Accept-Ranges`, no `206`/`416` (RFC 9110 §14.2 permits ignoring `Range`). `206` semantics belong to cached variants — served by the proxy or by storage, per the serve mode.

### Errors (JSON body)

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `401` | Invalid/missing signature |
| `404` | Source not found / not readable |
| `413` | Source exceeds `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` |
| `415` | Source not decodable (`undecodable_source`), or contains video (`video_source` — see §3.1) |
| `416` | `Range` unsatisfiable against a cached variant (proxy mode only) |
| `422` | Invalid or conflicting options |
| `429` | No slot in one of the two pools: either no render slot (the wait queue was full, or this request waited in it longer than `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` without reaching the front) or no probe slot (`AP_MAX_PROBE_CONCURRENCY` reached, §4.3 — that pool has no queue). `Retry-After` set either way, and which pool it was is deliberately not reported |
| `500` | The render failed for a reason that is not the client's: no encoder, no space, a diagnostic the classifier does not recognise |
| `500` | The storage backend a source names is misconfigured: no credentials, or a store that answers a redirect because the configured region or endpoint is not the object's. No client action can resolve either |
| `502` | The storage backend could not be reached: a transport failure, or a `5xx` from the store itself |
| `504` | A render started and then exceeded `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` |

The two `415`s are separate `error` values on one status because they are different verdicts: `undecodable_source` says the bytes could not be read, `video_source` says they were read and refused. A client told "not decodable" about a file every player opens would go looking for a corrupt upload.

That makes `415` the one status that discriminates between *contents*, which is a deliberate exception to the blindness the `404` row enforces — and it is sound only because of where it sits. Signature verification precedes it, so the answer is available exclusively to someone the operator already handed a URL for this exact source; and `415` at all (rather than `404`) already discloses that the source exists and is readable. Splitting "missing" from "unauthorized" was rejected for the opposite reason: those answers are reachable by anyone who can guess a path.

`probe_failed` (`500`) and `probe_timeout` (`504`) are two rows of their own rather than a reuse of the render pair. The bodies name the limit an operator would raise, and `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` is not that limit for a probe; an error naming the wrong variable sends them to the wrong place. Both are reachable **on either endpoint**: `/info` is a probe, and a render probes too before it starts (§3.1's audio-only gate), so a render URL answering `504 probe_timeout` means the gate's probe ran out of `AP_PROBE_TIMEOUT` before any encoding began.

Every other row is something the *client* got wrong, which is why `500` and `502` are worth stating rather than leaving to the adapter: a render can fail with none of them true, and answering a plausible `4xx` would tell a client to stop retrying something that might well work next time.

`502` is deliberately not the `404`. That row is blind on purpose, so no source failure can be used to probe what exists — but an outage is not a source failure. It says nothing about whether the object is there, and routing it into the `404` tells a client its object is gone when the store is merely unreachable: a deletion reported that did not happen, then cached for the ten seconds that row carries, suppressing the retry that would have worked. A store that answers `5xx` or does not answer at all is `502`; a store that says "no such object" — and one that refuses the credential, which stays indistinguishable from that by design — is the `404`.

`429` and `504` divide on whether a render ever ran, not on how long the client waited — both can take the full `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT`. A request that spent that budget queued for a slot has nothing to report about a render, so it is told to come back, with the same `Retry-After` a full queue would have given it up front. `504` means a render held a slot and then went silent. Answering `504` for a wait would name a timeout that never happened, and would tell a client its variant is too expensive to encode when the truth is that the box is busy.

Mid-stream render failure after `200` is signaled by abnormal termination of the chunked stream (nothing better exists over plain HTTP; one more argument for HLS in v2).

## 6. Configuration (env)

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AP_KEY`, `AP_SALT` | Hex-encoded HMAC key/salt; key must decode to ≥ 32 bytes (generate: `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `AP_ALLOW_INSECURE` | Accept unsigned URLs (dev only) |
| `AP_SOURCE_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated bucket/host patterns; unset accepts every bucket and refuses every host (§1) |
| `AP_LOCAL_ROOT` | Root directory for `local://` sources; unset = local sources disabled. Must exist at boot |
| `AP_VARIANT_STORE` | Variant store, scheme-tagged: `file:///path` or `s3://bucket`; unset = no cache, always render. Either scheme is proved writable at boot by performing a write and removing it — a directory that does not exist or refuses writes, or a bucket that is unreachable or refuses one, fails the container. `s3://` names a bucket only — a key prefix, a port or embedded credentials are refused rather than ignored |
| `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | Max simultaneous ffmpeg processes (default: CPU count). Coalesced requests share one, so this counts renders and not requests |
| `AP_MAX_PROBE_CONCURRENCY` | Max simultaneous ffprobe processes (default: 4 × `AP_MAX_CONCURRENCY`). A pool of its own so a probe never waits behind an encoder; concurrent requests for one source share a probe, so this counts probes and not requests. No queue — overflow is `429` — see §4.3 |
| `AP_QUEUE_SIZE` | Requests that may wait for a *render* slot before the next is answered `429` |
| `AP_READY_QUEUE_THRESHOLD` | Queue depth at which `/ready` answers `503`, recovering at half of it rounded down (default: half `AP_QUEUE_SIZE` rounded down, minimum 1; `0` disables, as does `AP_QUEUE_SIZE=0`). Refused above `AP_QUEUE_SIZE`, where it could never trip |
| `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES`, `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` | Abuse limits. `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES` bounds the *source*, checked before a render starts — the `413` above |
| `AP_MAX_VARIANT_BYTES` | Bytes one render may retain, defaulting to the effective `AP_MAX_SRC_BYTES`. Output past it kills the render; the response has already committed to `200`, so the outcome is a failed stream rather than a `413` |
| `AP_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | Seconds an `/info` probe may take before ffprobe is killed and the request answered `504` (default: 10). Separate from `AP_RENDER_TIMEOUT` because a probe reads headers rather than decoding — see §4.3 |
| `AP_SERVE_MODE` | `redirect` \| `proxy` |
| `AP_PRESIGN_TTL` | Seconds a HIT's presigned URL stays valid (default: 300); redirect mode only |
| `AP_LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warning` \| `error` (default: `info`) |
| `AP_METRICS_BIND`, `AP_METRICS_PORT` | Where the `/metrics` listener binds (default: `127.0.0.1`, `9568`). The endpoint is unsigned, so the bind is its access control; `AP_METRICS_BIND` is an address literal and a hostname is refused at boot, as is a port equal to the listener's |
| `AP_S3_ENDPOINT` | Origin URL of an S3-compatible store (`http://minio:9000`); unset = AWS proper. An origin and nothing else — a path, query, fragment or embedded credentials are refused at boot |
| `AP_S3_ADDRESSING` | `virtual` \| `path`: whether a request names its bucket in the host or in the path. Default: `virtual` with no `AP_S3_ENDPOINT`, `path` with one. Signed requests and presigned URLs always use the same style, since the host is inside the signature |
| `AP_S3_CA_BUNDLE` | PEM bundle to verify the store's certificate against, replacing the system trust store; a readable file at boot. There is no way to disable verification |

S3 credentials are the exception to the `AP_` rule and keep the standard AWS names — `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` and `AWS_REGION` (or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`) — validated as a group at boot: all of key, secret and region, or none. There is no IMDS or STS lookup, so credentials come from the environment or not at all.

Redirect serving is a *capability of the store's backend*: `redirect` answers a HIT with a 302 to a presigned variant URL, which only a backend that can presign (`s3://`) can produce. `AP_SERVE_MODE=redirect` against a store without that capability (`file://`) is refused at boot, with an error naming both variables — never per request.
